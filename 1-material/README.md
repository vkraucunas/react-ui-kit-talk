# Material-UI

## Installation
- `npm i -S material-ui`
- `npm i -S react-tap-event-plugin`
- Bring Roboto font into the project, I chose to do so thru a Google Font link tag in the HTML. Obviously not a best practice.

## Into the Code
- At `App.js` had to wrap it in `<MuiThemeProvider>`
- Import each component I would like to use. The documentation was very helpful here.
