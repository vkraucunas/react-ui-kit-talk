## Talk Abstract
UI Frameworks are meant to help engineers prototype new ideas swiftly and seamlessly. With the modular, componentized nature of React work, it is an awesome opportunity to use components that have styling and functionality ready to go. However, integrating these UI frameworks can sometimes be a chore. In this talk, I will be grading and comparing a handful of popular frameworks for their ease of integration, documentation, and functionality into a simple application.
